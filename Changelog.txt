Changed new file name to begin with 100
Added following new config values:
	    int QuicksaveCount = 10,
Added code to delete the oldest renamed quicksave files which exceed the QuicksaveCount
Added code to rename all the renamed quicksave files to start with 1001
Added Verbose level config
	// Verbose level Def
	//
	// 0 = no output after initial settings
	// 1 = normal output
	// 2 = More verbose output, with full filenames, etc
Modified Console.Writelines to not output the full path, but just the filename
Added  display of all options when program starts
Fixed bug which happened if program was looking at files at the moment a new save is being written, it initially gets a name ending in ".tmp"
